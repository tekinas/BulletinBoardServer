Slave:
	1) The slave receives a connection from the master. This itself is considered a pre-commit "message" from the master.
	2) The slave tries to acquire a local write lock. If it succeeds, it sends the character 'S' as a positive acknowledgement. Otherwise, it sends the character 'U' as a negative acknowledgement and quits the sync operation.
	3) The slave waits for the master to send a commit message within a timeout. If the master sends the character 'U' or the timeout occurs, the slave quits the sync operation. If the master sends a message of the form: W<poster><slash><msg><ln>, it is considered a write operation where "poster" is the poster of the message, "msg" is the message, "slash" denotes the slash character and "ln" denotes the new line character. Whereas, if the master sends a message of the form: R<num><space><poster><slash><msg><ln>, it is considered a replace operation where "num" is the message number, "poster" is the poster of the message, "msg" is the message, "slash" denotes the slash character and "space" denotes the space character separating the number and the poster. Any other form of message will be rejected, resulting in the slave quitting the sync operation.
	4) The slave performs the commit operation and sends the character 'S' to the master if it's successful, otherwise it sends the character 'U'.
	5) The slave will wait for the master to confirm the sync operation. If the master sends the character 'S' then the sync is complete. Otherwise, if the master sends the character 'U' or any character other than 'S' or if the timeout occurs then the slave will perform a revert/undo operation.

Master:
	1) The master sends a connection request to all its peer sync servers (slave). This connection request is considered a pre-commit "message" by the slaves.
	2) If all the slaves reply with the character 'S' then the pre-commit is successful. Otherwise, if any slave sends the character 'U' or any character other than 'S' or if the timeout occurs then the master will broadcast the character 'U' to all the slaves and quit the sync operation.
	3) The server broadcasts the commit message of the form: W<poster><slash><msg><ln> if it has received a "write" request or the message of the form R<num><space><poster><slash><msg><ln> if it has received a "replace" request.
	4) The server waits for all the slaves to send an acknowledgement. If all slaves send the character 'S' then it proceeds to perform the requested operation itself. If any slave sends the character 'U' or any character other than 'S' or if the timeout occurs then the server broadcasts the character 'U' to every slave and quits the sync operation.
	5) If the requested operation succeeds in the local machine then the master sends the character 'S' to all slaves indicating successful sync. Otherwise, it sends the character 'U', prompting the slaves to undo the write or replace operation.
